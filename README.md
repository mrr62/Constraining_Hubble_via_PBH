# Constraining_Hubble_via_PBH
Computational project exploring how various proposed primordial black hole models can be used to constrain the Hubble constant and explore cosmic expansion history independently of CMB and Standard Candle methods

The primordial black hole models include 4 mass functions: 
  1) Lognormal:  P(m, sigma, Mc) 
  2) Power Law: P(m, Mmin)
  3) Critical Collapse: P(m, alpha, Mf)
  4) Monochromatic: 1

and abundance fractions that depend on PBH mass. 
Varying these parameters offers a way to constrain the Hubble constant that is independent of the CMB and SN methods, which are currently in conflict. It is the hope that, with enough comparative data, a third method may offer more insight into why these discrepancies exist, and potentially offer hints as to which, if either, is "more correct". 

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS !! I can offer no conclusive insights, and as of now this project exists as an exercise into exploring the relationship between PBHs and the Hublle constant in a novel way, but offers no conclusive evidence on Hubble constraints. The margins of error are too large, and the real data being compared (gravitational wave data) is not expansive enough (only 42 data points).
